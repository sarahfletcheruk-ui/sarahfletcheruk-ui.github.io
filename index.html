  <h2>Praise For Sarah's Writing and Teaching</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “By turns evocative of English landscape paintings and frantic late-night conversations,
      Sarah Fletcher’s poems are highly mobile, troubled, troubling, rich and fraught.”
    </p>
— Chris Kraus, author of <em>I Love Dick</em>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “<em>PLUS ULTRA</em> is an alarming, accomplished and brilliant first collection.
      Fletcher’s ambition, formal invention, erudition and technical precision offer a compelling
      scaffold for poems that fizz and flit between vulnerability, wit and a brutal willingness
      to confront the world, and others, with a dark honesty that is frequently refreshing and,
      occasionally, genuinely menacing.”
    </p>
    — Ahren Warner
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “<em>PLUS ULTRA</em> is a wild, exciting, lyrical book, free-associative and narrative
      at the same time … Fletcher is a poet of the future, and lucky for us, she’s arrived just in time.”
    </p>
    — Matthew Dickman
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  <p>
    “Sarah is an excellent and generous teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and a lot of the activities had new and innovative prompts I hadn't explored before.”
  </p>
  — Poetry School “Writing Pain” participant
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    “My daughter loved working with Sarah. She is patient, intelligent and inspiring. My daughter now loves English and has even asked for more homework from Sarah!”

  <h2>Academics & Research</h2>

  <p>
    Sarah Fletcher is in the final year of a PhD at Aberystwyth University titled
    <em>Writing Pain</em>, an interdisciplinary research project examining language,
    metaphor, and chronic pain. The doctorate is conducted in collaboration with the
    Powys Pain and Fatigue Management Clinic and the University of Reading, and is
    supervised by Jacqueline Yallop.
  </p>

  <p>
    In November 2024, she delivered a paper titled <em>“Poetry as an Epistemic Tool”</em>
    at All Souls College, Oxford, as part of the <em>Poetry and Philosophy</em> conference.
    The paper explored poetry as a mode of knowledge-production rather than expression.
  </p>

  <p>
    Her essay <em>“In Defence of Inspiration”</em>, originally presented at Aberystwyth
    University, was later published in <em>Wild Court</em>, an international poetry journal
    based in King’s College London’s English Department.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier academic papers include <em>“Who Will Forgive Me for the Things I Do?
    Anne Sexton’s Formal Influence on Sylvia Plath”</em>, presented at the
    <em>Sylvia Plath: Letters, Words and Fragments</em> conference at Ulster University
    in 2017, and <em>“What Does It Mean for Poetry to Engage in the Real World?”</em>,
    delivered at the Vox Conference at the University of Kent in 2014.
